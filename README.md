# PLPBasicGitAssignment
Basic Git and GitHub workflow.

## Step 1
I have created a repository on GitHub "PLPBasicGitAssignment" and initialize it with README to highlight the steps I will take.

## Step 2
I have open my cmd on local computer to access my documents where i'm going to save a new folder "PLPBasicGitAssignment" using the command `mkdir PLPBasicGitAssignment`, and navigate it usind the command, `cd PLPBasicGitAssignment`.

## Step 3
This step I will initialize my repository using the Git command, `git init`.

## Step 4
My local repo is not linked to my GitHub repo so I will link it using the command, `git remote add origin <my GitHub repo url>`.

## Step 5
This step I will add a new file to my local folder using the command, `touch hello.txt`. The most exciting part is to add text to my file using, `echo Hello, Kelvin >>hello.txt`.

## Step 6
My text file is not tracked, I need to track it using `git add hello.txt` and commit the changes using `git commit -m "Add hello.txt with a greeting"`.

## Step 7
To upload the commits to my GitHub I will use, `git push -u origin main`.
